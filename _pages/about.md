I am a Humboldt Postdoctoral Research Fellow with the Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at Friedrich-Alexander-Universität Erlangen-Nürnberg (FAU), under the supervision of Prof. Dr.-Ing. [Robert Schober](https://www.idc.tf.fau.eu/person/robert-schober/#Publications). I received my B.S. and M.S. degrees from the Beijing Institute of Technology (BIT), China, in 2015 and 2019, respectively, where my undergraduate thesis advisor and M.S. supervisor was Prof. [Chengwen Xing](https://pure.bit.edu.cn/en/persons/chengwen-xing). I obtained my Ph.D. degree from Queen Mary University of London (QMUL), UK, in 2022, under the supervision of Prof. [Cunhua Pan](https://radio.seu.edu.cn/newenglish/pch_en/main.psp) and Prof. [Michael Chai](https://www.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/~michaelc/). I am currently serving as an [Editor for the IEEE Transactions on Communications](https://www.comsoc.org/publications/journals/ieee-tcom/ieee-transactions-communications-editorial-board) and the guest editor for IEEE Transactions on Cognitive Communications and Networking on the special issue on [Fluid Antenna Systems and Other Reconfigurable Antenna Technologies: From Conventional Designs to AI-Driven Networks](https://www.comsoc.org/publications/journals/ieee-tccn/cfp/fluid-antenna-systems-and-other-reconfigurable-antenna).

My research interests include:
- Transceiver Design and Channel Estimation in Reconfigurable Arrays (RIS, FAS, PAS)
